    "- **Newer cars (lower car age)** are consistently valued higher.\n",
    "- **Low mileage (odometer reading)** is strongly correlated with higher prices.\n",
    "- **Drive type matters** — vehicles with 4WD or FWD tend to have higher price ranges.\n",
    "- **Condition is crucial** — cars marked as “excellent” or “like new” significantly outperform “fair” or “salvage” vehicles.\n",
    "- **Manufacturer has limited impact**, though some brands (e.g., Toyota, GMC, RAM) show stronger value retention.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 💼 Business Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prioritize newer inventory** — focus on acquiring cars under 10 years old.\n",
    "2. **Avoid high-mileage vehicles** — prefer listings with under 120,000 miles.\n",
    "3. **Stock more 4WD and FWD vehicles**, especially for SUV and truck categories.\n",
    "4. **Ensure accurate and consistent condition reporting** — high-condition ratings drive better pricing.\n",
