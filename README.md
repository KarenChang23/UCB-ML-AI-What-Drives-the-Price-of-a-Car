# ðŸš— What Drives the Price of a Car?
## CRISP-DM Project Report

---

## 1. Business Understanding

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The goal of this project is to help a **used car dealership** understand what factors influence the price of a used car. By analyzing a large dataset of used vehicles, we aim to uncover patterns and relationships between car features and their market value.

The dealership can use these insights to:
- Make smarter inventory decisions
- Price vehicles more accurately
- Increase profitability

---

### ðŸ’¼ Key Business Questions
- Do newer cars have higher resale prices?
- How does mileage (odometer reading) affect car price?
- Are certain **brands or models** priced higher?
- Does the **condition** of the car impact its value?
- What about features like **transmission type**, **fuel type**, or **drive train**?

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Target Variable
- **`price`** â€” This is the column we want to predict.

---

### ðŸ“¦ Important Features to Explore
- `year`: Indicates the age of the car
- `odometer`: Mileage; often a key factor in value
- `manufacturer` and `model`: Brand influence
- `condition`: Reported physical/working condition
- `cylinders`, `fuel`, `title_status`, `transmission`, `drive`
- `type`: SUV, truck, sedan, etc.
- `paint_color`: May or may not influence price

---

### ðŸ§  Business Impact
By answering these questions, the dealership will know what car features to prioritize in their purchasing and pricing strategies. The outcome will guide **data-driven decisions** instead of relying solely on intuition or guesswork.
